1) Alma Linux can be downloaded from

http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/almalinux/9.0/isos/x86_64/

Suggested to use 'minimal' iso if a graphical environent is not needed.
use 'dvd' if a graphical environment is needed.  Alternatively minimal can 
be used and the graphical environment setup at the bottom of this file can be run.

2) Many different Virtual Machine Managers can be used.  Please ensure that
the host can make network connections to the virtual machine.  Testing will
be difficult otherwise.

3) Hard Drive should be 20G in size

4) Once The VM is running, ensure that you can SSH into the machine
along with having 'console' access.

In the virtual machine (either SSH or console) 

5) Run the following commands inside the virtual machine

```
su
dnf update -y
dnf install epel-release -y
dnf install clang -y
dnf --enablerepo=crb install libbpf-devel -y
dnf install netcat cockpit bpftool -y
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket

exit # to exit from root privileges

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
((choose 1 for default))
source "$HOME/.cargo/env/
```

6) Copy the project.tar.gz onto the virtual Machine
eg (on the host)
scp project.tar.gz <username>@<ip of vm>:/home/<username>/
for the user mm with an ip of the virtual machine as 192.168.0.43 the command is
scp project.tar.gz mm@192.168.0.43:/home/mm/

7) Run the following commands inside the virtual machine to test the rust compiler
```
tar -xzvf project.tar.gz
cd port_blocker
cargo check
```

You should compile a lot of Rust code, but run into the first compilation error

8) Run the following commands in the virtual machine to test if clang is available
```
make bpf
```

You should be presented with a compiler warning, but target/bpf/block.bpf.o 
should exist

EDITORS

You can install an editor via
sudo dnf install nvim
sudo dnv install vim
sudo dnf install nano
sudo dnf install emacs

GRAPHICAL ENVIRONMENT FROM MINIMAL ISO

sudo dnf group install "Server with GUI"
sudo systemctl enable --now gdm

NOTE: Upon reboot the gui might not start up. In such a case you will need to
`sudo systemctl start gdm` on every reboot

After logging in, You may need to re-enable networking after this.  To do so
In the upper right hand corner of the GUI. Click Settings.  Click on Network
Click the + button next to "Wired".  Click Add.  You should now have network
access

Visual Studio Code as an EDITOR
Instructions can be found here:

Alma Linux 9 is based on Fedora 34 and thus uses the dnf method of (Fedora 22 and above)
